##Design and Application of General Data Structure for Particle System 
* Main properties of particle:
  * spatial location
  * velocity
  * survival  time
  * shape
  * size
  * gravity factor 

* Properties change over time 
* Particle system should:
  * initialise particles
  * emit particles
  * render particles
  * eliminate particles
